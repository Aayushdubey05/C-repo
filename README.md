# C++ Standard Template Library (STL) Repository

This repository contains examples and explanations of various components of the C++ Standard Template Library (STL). The STL is a powerful set of C++ template classes to provide general-purpose classes and functions with templates that implement many popular and commonly used algorithms and data structures.

## Introduction

The C++ Standard Template Library (STL) is a collection of classes and functions that are commonly used in C++ programming. It provides implementations of various data structures (such as vectors, lists, and maps) and algorithms (such as sorting and searching) that are efficient, flexible, and easy to use.

This repository aims to provide examples and explanations of how to use different components of the STL effectively in your C++ programs.
